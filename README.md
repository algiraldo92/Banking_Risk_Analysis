# Banking_Risk_Analysis

This project involves not only financial analysis but also the use of data analysis techniques to clean and preprocess the data, including the handling of missing or null values.

This project involves preparing a report for a bank’s lending division. We aim to determine whether a client’s marital status and number of children have an impact on loan default. The bank already has some data on customers’ creditworthiness.

The report will be taken into account when creating a credit score for a potential client. A credit score is used to assess a potential borrower’s ability to repay a loan.
